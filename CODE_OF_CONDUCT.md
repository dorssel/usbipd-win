# Minimalist Code of Conduct

We believe that an elaborate code of conduct invites a lot of fighting
over intricate details, much like law, and we do not have the resources
to build up the equivalent of a legal system. Therefore, we prefer keeping
our rules as short as possible and filling the gaps with the mortar of
human interaction: empathy.

All we ask of members of this project is this:

1. Please treat each other with respect and understanding.
2. Please respect our wish to not serve as a stage for disputes about
   fairness or personal differences.

If you can agree to these conditions, your contributions are welcome.
If you cannot, please don't spoil it for the rest of us.
